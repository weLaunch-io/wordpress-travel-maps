## Troubleshooting

#### How can I embed a Travel Map into a page?

Easy! Just create a new blank page in wordpress and insert the following shortcode:

<pre>[travel_map id="XXX" height="400px" width="100%"]</pre>

Make sure you set the ID to your travel maps ID. If you have Visual Composer running you will find a VC shortcode called Travel Map.
